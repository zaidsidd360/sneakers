This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. I won't be uploading this as a solution to FE mentor as I believe my design has deviated a little too much from the given design.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Sneakers3D](https://zaidsidd360.github.io/sneakers)

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Spline](https://spline.design/) - Tool for 3D web experiences
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to work with the useReducer hook and learn the under-the-hood workings of it. Also, I want to keep working with Spline tool more and maybe even dive into some Three.js or React-three-fiber. Working with 3D is epic!
